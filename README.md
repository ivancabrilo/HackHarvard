# HackHarvard
Chat GPT can be jail broken and harmful data and information can be spread. In this year's Hackathon at Harvard University, I made an attempt to make an open source program that uses GPT turbo 3.5, and collects data from users, so I can fine tune the chatbot and enforce security of GPT 3.5.
I made an application using Flask and Python togehter with openai API, to collect the feedback of the users on potentially dangerous responses. 
Here is an example of how app works, all data both harmful and unharmful gets saved together with users' inputs, chatbot outputs, and users' feedbacks to make an effort to prevent GPT from being jail broken.
